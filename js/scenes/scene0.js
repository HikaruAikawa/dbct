	["talk", "detective", "But I suppose you already know that, since you're asking about him. Can't say I get a lot of questions about old cases like this one."],
	["talk", "detective", "You're sure as hell not a relative. Judging by those clothes you're wearing, you won't see as much money as Mortin had in your entire life."],

	["talk", "butler", "A shocking event, no doubt. None of us is quite sure how to react, but Lady Addenworth requested that we call you immediately. I have also been instructed to wait for your arrival before informing the authorities."],
